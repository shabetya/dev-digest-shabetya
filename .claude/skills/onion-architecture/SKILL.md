# Onion Architecture (backend)

Which ring code belongs in, and which way imports may point, in `server/` and
`reviewer-core/`. Distilled from ~45 sources (Palermo, Cockburn, Martin, Fowler,
official Fastify/Drizzle/Zod docs, Node.js Best Practices, maintainer talks) —
every claim is sourced in [README.md](README.md).

Sibling skills — do not duplicate their territory:
- `fastify-best-practices` — plugins, hooks, lifecycle, serialization mechanics
- `drizzle-orm-patterns` — query, relation, and migration idioms
- `zod` — schema authoring idioms
- `postgresql-table-design` — physical schema, indexes, constraints
- `frontend-architecture` — the client-side counterpart of this skill

## Core Principles

1. **Dependencies point inward, always.** Code may depend on layers more central
   than itself; nothing may depend on a layer further out. This is the one rule
   the other twelve are consequences of.
2. **The domain is the center; Postgres, Fastify, GitHub, and the LLM SDKs are
   external details.** The database is not the center — it is a plugged-in
   device, and so is the web framework.
3. **Inner layers define interfaces, outer layers implement them.** A port is a
   specification owned by the core; the adapter lives at the edge. Test doubles
   are adapters like any other.
4. **The core must compile and run with no infrastructure present.**
   `reviewer-core` is the proof: it has exactly two dependencies (`zod`,
   `openai` for types), no DB, no filesystem, no `process.env`. If a change to
   it would break that, the change belongs in `server/`.
5. **Package by module, layer inside the module.** The repo root is organized by
   domain (`modules/agents`, `modules/reviews`), not by technical layer. Layers
   are the structure *inside* a module, never the top-level folder scheme.
6. **The number of rings is not the point.** Sources give three, four, or five.
   Consensus exists on direction, not on count — do not add a layer because a
   diagram has one.

## Layer Map

The normative reference for "where does this go".

| Ring | Holds | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Domain core | Review pipeline, prompt assembly, grounding, structured output; pure module logic | `reviewer-core/src`, `modules/*/helpers.ts`, `modules/reviews/findings.ts` |
| Ports (core-owned interfaces) | `LLMProvider`, `GitClient`, `GitHubClient`, `CodeIndex`, `Embedder`, `AuthProvider`, `SecretsProvider`; module facades | `vendor/shared/adapters.ts`, `modules/repo-intel/types.ts` (`RepoIntel`) |
| Application services | Orchestration, transaction boundaries, job registration, event emission | `modules/*/service.ts`, `modules/reviews/run-executor.ts` |
| Persistence adapters | Drizzle queries, row→domain mapping | `modules/*/repository.ts` (+ `repository/` split by aggregate) |
| Driven adapters | octokit, simple-git, ripgrep, ast-grep, OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter, tiktoken, dependency-cruiser | `adapters/*` |
| Driving adapters | HTTP routes, SSE streams, job handlers | `modules/*/routes.ts`, the callbacks passed to `jobs.register` |
| Composition root | Config parsing, container wiring, job runner, run bus, error handler | `platform/config.ts`, `platform/container.ts`, `platform/jobs.ts`, `platform/sse.ts`, `app.ts` |

- **`platform/prompt.ts`, `platform/grounding.ts`, `platform/structured.ts` are
  re-export shims** over `reviewer-core`. They exist so server code imports one
  path; fix the engine, never the shim.
- **`platform/` is composition-root territory, not a junk drawer.** Something
  belongs there when the whole app needs one instance of it. A rule that only
  one module needs belongs in that module.

## Module Anatomy & the Promotion Ladder

A module grows layers as it earns them; it does not start with all of them.

| Stage | Files | Promote when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — routes-only | `routes.ts` | — |
| 2 — + service | `+ service.ts` | a business rule appears, a second caller needs the same operation, or the handler exceeds "parse, delegate, map" |
| 3 — + repository | `+ repository.ts` | the module owns tables, or a query is issued from more than one place |
| 4 — split repository | `repository.ts` facade + `repository/*.repo.ts` | the repository covers several aggregates (`modules/reviews/` is the worked example) |

- **Routes-only (no `service.ts`) is a legitimate resting stage for a module
  with no business rules to protect** — `polling` and `workspace` have little
  enough logic that skipping a service layer isn't debt by itself.
- **What's a violation regardless of stage is `routes.ts` querying the database
  directly.** All four of `polling`, `pulls`, `settings`, `workspace` (four of
  this repo's eight modules) import `drizzle-orm` and `db/schema` straight into
  `routes.ts` today. Even a trivial module owes itself a thin `repository.ts` —
  a two-function one is enough — so the DB import lives in exactly one place;
  `pulls` additionally has enough logic (status derivation, comment posting)
  that it's really stage-3 work stuck in a stage-1 file.
- **Supporting files per module:** `constants.ts` (kinds, limits, job names),
  `helpers.ts` (pure mapping and rules), `types.ts` (the module's port when it
  exposes a facade). Anything importable by another module goes through the
  container, never by reaching into a sibling module's folder.
- **Cross-module access is via the container** (`container.agentsRepo`,
  `container.repoIntel`). A module importing `../otherModule/service.js`
  couples two domains at the source level; the container makes the dependency
  a wiring decision instead.

## Thin Routes

A handler does four things in order: **parse → resolve context → delegate → map**.

- **Validation is schema-first.** Declare `schema.params` / `schema.body` with
  zod via `fastify-type-provider-zod`; invalid input is rejected before the
  handler runs. Never hand-roll `Schema.parse(req.body)` inside a handler.
- **`request` and `reply` never travel inward.** A service takes plain values.
  If a service signature mentions Fastify, the layering is already broken —
  the exception is `getContext(container, req)` in `modules/_shared/context.ts`,
  which exists precisely so the adaptation happens in exactly one place.
- **Every route resolves tenancy through `getContext`**, then passes
  `workspaceId` down. Workspace scoping is a service/repository argument, not
  something the DB layer infers.
- **Declare `schema.response`.** It is an output *allowlist* — it strips fields
  the handler did not promise, which is a security boundary, not a formality.
  No route in this repo declares one today, so the serializer compiler wired in
  `app.ts` currently compiles nothing. New routes should declare it.
- **Errors are thrown, not shaped.** Throw `NotFoundError` / `ValidationError` /
  `ExternalServiceError` from `platform/errors.ts`; the single error handler in
  `app.ts` maps them to status codes. A handler building its own error body
  duplicates a decision made once.
- **DTO mapping happens at the edge**, in `helpers.ts` (`toAgentDto`), not in
  the service and never by returning a Drizzle row.

## Ports & Adapters

**The test for "is this an adapter?": does the code leave the process?** Network,
disk, subprocess, clock, randomness. If it does not, it is core logic wherever it
currently sits — `adapters/git/diff-parser.ts` (`parseUnifiedDiff`) and
`adapters/codeindex/extract.ts` (`extractEndpoints`) are pure functions filed
under `adapters/`, and a service importing them is not a layering violation.
Classify by behavior, not by folder.

Adding a new external tool, in order:

1. **Define the port first** — an interface in `vendor/shared/adapters.ts` for
   app-wide capabilities, or in the module's `types.ts` for a module-scoped
   facade. It is written in the vocabulary of the caller, not of the library.
2. **Implement it in `adapters/<capability>/<impl>.ts`.** The SDK's types stay
   inside that file. This is an anti-corruption layer: its job is to translate a
   vendor's model into ours so a vendor change lands in one file.
3. **Add a test double in `adapters/mocks.ts`** implementing the same interface.
   If writing the mock is awkward, the port is shaped like the library instead
   of like the need.
4. **Wire it in `platform/container.ts`** as a lazy getter, and add the override
   slot to `ContainerOverrides`.

- **A port earns its keep in exactly two cases:** the thing behind it is outside
  your control (anti-corruption), or a second implementation is realistic.
  `LLMProvider` scores on both — three providers today, all with different SDKs.
  A one-implementation wrapper over your own code scores on neither: inline it
  and depend on the concrete module.
- **`vendor/shared/` is the canonical copy**, hand-mirrored into
  `client/src/vendor/shared/` with no sync script. Changing a port here means
  porting the delta by hand — see the root `AGENTS.md`.
- **Adapter resilience is the adapter's business.** Retries, timeouts, and
  backoff (`platform/resilience.ts`) wrap the edge; a service must not encode
  "this provider is flaky".

## Persistence

- **Repositories are the only code that touches the DB for their domain**, and
  they are domain-shaped, not table-shaped: methods read like the ubiquitous
  language (`markReviewed`, `setFindingDismissed`), not `findByXAndY`.
- **Drizzle row types stop at the repository boundary.** A `$inferSelect` type in
  a route signature or an API response makes the wire contract a mirror of the
  physical schema, so a column rename becomes a breaking API change. Map to the
  contract types from `@devdigest/shared`.
- **The caller owns the transaction; the repository receives it.** Start
  `db.transaction()` in the service and pass the typed handle down as an
  optional last parameter — repositories never call `db.transaction()`
  themselves, because only the caller knows what the unit of work is.
- **Nothing in this repo currently runs in a transaction.** The
  `insertReview → insertFindings → markReviewed` sequence in
  `modules/reviews/run-executor.ts` and the `delete`+`insert` of `pr_files` /
  `pr_commits` in `modules/pulls/routes.ts` are the two places that need one.
  Treat this section as prescriptive, not descriptive.
- **A repository query that is issued from a second module means the entity is
  shared** — construct the repository in the container (as `agentsRepo` and
  `reviewRepo` already are) rather than instantiating it per module.

## Validation

Two kinds of validation, both mandatory, at different rings:

| | Transport validation | Domain invariants |
|---|---|---|
| Where | route schema, at the edge | inside the core |
| Input is | untrusted | already parsed |
| A failure means | the caller sent something wrong | **a bug in our code** |
| Result | 4xx (422 here) | throw |

- **Parse, don't validate.** The boundary consumes loose input and produces a
  typed value; inner layers accept only that type and never re-check its shape.
  A service that defensively re-validates its arguments is a symptom of the
  boundary not being trusted.
- **Check once, at the edge.** Validation scattered through processing steps is
  the failure mode the literature calls shotgun parsing.
- **Invalid input is not exceptional** — it is an expected outcome with a status
  code. An invariant violation *is* exceptional, and swallowing it hides a bug.
- Zod at the boundary makes the schema the single source of truth for both the
  runtime check and the static type (`z.infer`). Do not maintain a hand-written
  interface next to a schema that already describes it.

## Config & Secrets

- **Exactly two files may read `process.env`:** `platform/config.ts` (parses the
  environment once, at boot, through a zod schema) and
  `adapters/secrets/local.ts` (the `SecretsProvider` fallback). Everything else
  receives config as a value.
- **Secrets are not config.** API keys and `GITHUB_TOKEN` go through
  `SecretsProvider` — not `AppConfig`, not the DB, not the environment read
  directly. The port exists so the storage (a `0600` file today) can change
  without touching feature code.
- **Config is a composition-root argument.** A service reading a feature flag
  from a global cannot be tested with that flag flipped; take it as a
  constructor value or read it off the container.
- The codebase should be publishable open-source at any moment without leaking a
  credential — that is the practical test for whether something is config or a
  secret.

## Dependency Injection

- **One composition root.** `platform/container.ts` constructs everything; it is
  the only place that knows which concrete class satisfies which port. Its
  lazy getters exist so an unused adapter never demands a key at boot.
- **Tests inject through `ContainerOverrides`,** not by mocking modules.
  Module-level mocking couples the test to the import graph; passing an object
  that satisfies the interface tests the seam the architecture already has.
- **No DI framework at this size.** Containers earn their keep at dozens of
  services or when per-request scoping and disposal are needed. Manual wiring in
  one file is the consensus for an app this size — a container is optional
  tooling, not part of the pattern.
- **Fastify decorators are legitimate DI at the delivery ring only.** Below it,
  dependencies are constructor arguments, so a service's needs are visible in
  its signature rather than resolved from an ambient registry.
- **Existing services take the whole `Container`** (`constructor(private
  container: Container)`). It is a type-only import and it keeps override-based
  testing working, so it is not worth a sweeping refactor — but a **new** service
  should take the capabilities it actually uses, because a wide dependency hides
  what a class touches and makes its tests over-provision.

## Async Work: Jobs, Queues, Streams

- **A job handler is a driving adapter, exactly like a route handler.** It may
  adapt a payload and call a service; it may not hold business rules. The
  callbacks registered in `modules/repos/service.ts` and
  `modules/repo-intel/service.ts` are the boundary — the work belongs in the
  methods they call.
- **`enqueue` is the port; the queue is infrastructure.** `p-queue`,
  concurrency, timeouts, retries, and the `jobs` table are `platform/jobs.ts`'s
  private business. A caller says *what* should happen later, never *how* it is
  scheduled.
- **Services emit run events through the injected bus** (`container.runBus`);
  only `routes.ts` touches `reply.sse`. The producer must not know whether
  anyone is listening — that is what makes the same run executable from CI with
  no HTTP connection attached.
- **Cancellation is a checkpoint the core reads, not a transport concern.**
  `run-executor.ts` polls `runBus.isCancelled(runId)` between units of work;
  the HTTP layer only sets the flag.
- **Events emitted before the write commits can outlive a rollback.** The bus is
  in-memory, so a crash loses buffered events by construction; anything that
  must survive is persisted (the run trace is written as one document on
  completion). If a future event must be delivered exactly once, the pattern to
  reach for is a transactional outbox, not a bigger buffer.

## Testing Shape

The test suite mirrors the architecture: **a honeycomb, not a pyramid** — many
integration tests through the module's own edges, few implementation-detail unit
tests.

- **Unit-test the pure core with no mocks.** `reviewer-core` and `helpers.ts` /
  `findings.ts` are pure by construction — if a test there needs a mock, the
  code under test is not actually core.
- **Integration-test through the API with a real Postgres.** Name DB-backed
  tests `*.it.test.ts`; that suffix is what splits the lanes. Testcontainers
  gives the same DB product as production — never mock the database.
- **A DB-backed test not named `*.it.test.ts` runs in the unit lane** and fails
  on any machine without Docker. Conversely, integration tests self-skip without
  a Docker daemon, so a green `pnpm test` is not proof the DB paths ran.
- **Fake other people's services, not your own code.** GitHub, the LLM
  providers, and the git binary get mocks from `adapters/mocks.ts`; your own
  service and repository do not.
- **The mock set is an adapter set.** When a port changes, `mocks.ts` must
  change with it — that compile error is the architecture doing its job.

## When NOT to Layer

The pattern is for behavior-rich modules, not for everything.

- **Onion is explicitly not for small applications** — its author excludes them
  by name. A module that reads a row and returns it has no domain to protect.
- **CRUD can be simpler.** Layer where significant business rules exist; a
  pass-through service that only forwards to a repository is ceremony, and the
  honest alternative is a transaction script in the service with no domain
  objects at all.
- **An anemic domain model incurs the cost of a domain model with none of the
  benefits.** If the "domain objects" are data bags, do not add a mapper layer
  to move data between three shapes of the same record.
- **Full transport/domain separation is a large effort** — prioritize a real
  domain boundary over a complete set of rings. Fastify's own reference apps
  demonstrate *less* layering than this repo already has; a codebase with
  `adapters/` and a container is a deliberate step beyond the baseline, and each
  further step needs its own justification.
- **Per-module choice is allowed.** Minimize coupling between modules, maximize
  cohesion inside one, and let a simple module stay simple.

## Enforcement

Convention that nothing checks is convention that drifts. `dependency-cruiser`
is already a `server/` dependency (it runs in-process as the depgraph adapter),
so a `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` rules file costs no new dependency and can run
as its own `pnpm` script today. Neither `server/` nor `client/` currently has
ESLint installed at all — adding `eslint` + `typescript-eslint` is a separate,
larger decision (a new dependency, a config, a CI step) worth making on its own
rather than bundling into this skill. Until then, `dependency-cruiser` is the
one mechanical enforcer available. The rules worth mechanizing, as `forbidden`
entries:

| Rule | `from` → `to` |
|---|---|
| The core stays pure | `^reviewer-core/src` → `^server/src` |
| Transport never queries | `^src/modules/[^/]+/routes\.ts$` → `^src/db/schema` or `drizzle-orm` |
| No cross-module imports | `^src/modules/([^/]+)/` → `^src/modules/([^/]+)/` with `pathNot: ^src/modules/$1/` (allow `_shared/`) |
| The container is wired, not reached for | anything except `app.ts`, `modules/*/routes.ts`, `modules/*/service.ts` → `platform/container.js` |
| One env chokepoint | anything except `platform/config.ts`, `adapters/secrets/` → `process.env` |

Group matching with a `$1` back-reference expresses the cross-module rule in a
single entry; `reachable: true` covers transitive violations. Add a rule when a
review catches the same violation twice — not preemptively for rules nobody has
broken.

## Known Judgment Calls

Where respected sources genuinely disagree — decide per case, and do not present
either side as law:

- **Repository over a thin ORM.** Drizzle is deliberately close to SQL, and an
  ORM context is arguably already a repository. The weak justification is
  "swap the database"; the strong ones are a testing seam and aggregate
  encapsulation.
- **How many rings.** Three, four, or five depending on the author. Direction is
  the invariant; count is taste.
- **A separate domain model vs. the persistence model.** Two models plus mappers
  pay off only when there is real behavior to protect; otherwise inferred types
  plus a service is cheaper and more honest.
- **Transaction propagation:** passing an explicit `tx` handle (visible, threads
  a parameter through signatures) vs. AsyncLocalStorage (clean signatures,
  implicit, framework-coupled). Explicit passing is the better-documented
  Drizzle pattern.
- **Decorators as DI vs. explicit parameters** — anything reachable through
  `fastify.x` is a service locator; the resolution used here is to allow it at
  the delivery ring only.
- **Container-wide injection vs. narrow dependencies** — this repo does the
  former (see *Dependency Injection*); both are defensible, mixing them
  arbitrarily is not.
- **Uniform layering vs. per-module choice** — vertical slices argue every
  feature picks its own internals; the middle position (modules outside, layers
  inside where warranted) is the one this repo already embodies.
